    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gulab Jamun is a classic Indian dessert made from soft, deep-fried milk-based dough balls soaked in fragrant sugar syrup. It’s loved for its rich sweetness and melt-in-the-mouth texture.</p>

<p>Often served warm during festivals, celebrations, or special occasions, gulab jamun is a beloved treat across India and around the world. Its golden-brown color and sugary aroma make it as visually appealing as it is delicious.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup milk powder</li>
    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ghee or clarified butter</li>
    <li>1/4 cup milk (adjust to make dough)</li>
    <li>Oil or ghee for deep frying</li>
    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>4–5 cardamom pods, crushed</li>
    <li>Few strands of saffron (optional)</li>
    <li>Rose water or kewra essence (optional, for flavor)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a bowl, mix milk powder, all-purpose flour, and ghee. Gradually add milk to form a soft, smooth dough. Let it rest for 5–10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into small, smooth balls, ensuring there are no cracks.</li>
    <li>Heat oil or ghee in a deep pan over low to medium heat. Fry the balls slowly, stirring gently, until they turn golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
    <li>In a separate pan, prepare sugar syrup by boiling sugar and water together until sugar dissolves. Add crushed cardamom, saffron, and rose water/kewra if using.</li>
    <li>Place the fried gulab jamun balls into the warm sugar syrup and let them soak for at least 30 minutes to absorb the sweetness.</li>
    <li>Serve warm or at room temperature, garnished with chopped nuts if desired.</li>
